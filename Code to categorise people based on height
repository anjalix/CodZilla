One can classify people on their height from the following table (different for men and women).
               Code  Men    Women
    Very Tall  "VT"  183     175
    Tall        "T"  175     168
    Medium      "M"  168     160
    Short       "S"  152     145
    Very Short "VS" <152    <145
Write code which determines the height code and stores it in variable hCode
    gender is in variable male (1 if male, 0 if female)
    height (in cms) is in variable h
int male;  /* Gender : 1 if male, 0 if female */
int h;  /* Height in cms */
char *hCode;  /* Variable where height code is to be stored */
    hCode = "VS";

/* Write code (including new variables) to store grade based on on number of subjects and the total marks */
/* Write code (including new variables) to store grade based on on number of subjects and the total marks */
char* height(int male, int h)
{
if(male==1)
{
if(h>=183) {return "VT"; }
else if(h>=175) {return "T"; }
else if(h>=168) {return "M"; }
else if(h>=152) {return "S"; }
else  {return "VS"; }
}
else
{

if(h>=175) {return "VT"; }
else if(h>=168) {return "T"; }
else if(h>=160) {return "M"; }
else if(h>=145) {return "S"; }
else  {return "VS"; }



}

}
hCode=height(male,h);




 
 Wow! Your solution is 100% correct!
