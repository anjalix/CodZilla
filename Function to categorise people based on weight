One can classify people on their weight from the following table (based on percent of their height)
               Code  Rule (% of height in cms)
    Very Fat   "VF"  >200% of height in cms
    Fat         "F"  >170% of height in cms
    Stout       "S"  >130% of height in cms
    Regular     "R"  >100% of height in cms
    Thin        "T"  > 70% of height in cms
    Skinny     "VT"  < 70% of height in cms
Write a function which determines the weight code and stores it in variable wCode given parameters
    integer height (in cms) 
    float weight (in kgs)
/*
 * The function getWeight accepts integer h (height in cms) and float w (weight in kgs)
 * It should compute and return the weight code based on height and weight
 */
char *getWeight(int h, float w)
{

/* Write code (including new variables) to return weight code based on height and weight */
if(w>h*2) {return "VF";}
else if(w>h*1.7) {return "F";}
else if(w>h*1.3) {return "S";}
else if(w>h) {return "R";}
else if(w>h*0.7) {return "T";}
else  {return "VT";}







}
 
 Wow! Your solution is 100% correct!
