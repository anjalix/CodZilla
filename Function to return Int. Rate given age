Fixed deposit interest rate for a senior citizen (attaining age 60) is 0.5% more than others
The fixed deposit interest rate for others is 8.25% per annum
Write a function interestRate which computes and returns the fixed deposite interest rate when age is passed as a parameter.
/*
 * The function interestRate accepts an integer a (age of a person)
 * It computes and returns the fixed deposit interest rate based on the age
 * Fixed deposit interest rate for a senior citizen (attaining age 60) is 0.5% more than others
 * The fixed deposit interest rate for others is 8.25% per annum
 */
float interestRate(int a)
{

float rate=8.25;
if(a>=60) rate+=0.5;

return rate;

}
