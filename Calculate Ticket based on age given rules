Calculate Ticket based on age given rules authored by Avinash Awate

Cost of a rail ticket for child less than 12 years is Rs. 10.
For senior citizens (attaining age 60) the rail ticket cost is RS. 15.
For everyone else it is Rs. 20.
Write code which computes the ticket cost in variable cost when variable a contains age
int a;  /* Age of person travelling by rail */
int cost;  /* Cost of rail ticket for person of age (variable) a */

/* Write code to compute and return ticket Cost based on age variable a */

if(a<12)
 {cost=10;}
else if(a>=60) {cost=15;}
else cost=20;
