Write code which
    subtracts three times variable a from four times variable b.
    divides the difference by variable c.
    stores the remainder in variable result.
int a;
int b;
int c;
int result;  /* To store the calculated result */
/* Write code
     to subtract three times variable a from four times variable b,
     divide the difference by variable c and
     store the remainder in variable result */


result = (4*b-3*a)%c;
Wow! Your solution is 100% correct!
