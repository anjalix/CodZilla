Cost of a rail ticket for child less than 12 years is Rs. 10.
For senior citizens (attaining age 60) the rail ticket cost is RS. 15.
For everyone else it is Rs. 20.
Write a function ticketCost which computes and returns the ticket cost when age is passsed as a parameter.
/*
 * The function ticketCost accepts an integer a (age of a person)
 * It computes and returns the cost of a rail ticket based on the age
 * For children less than 12, ticket cost is 10
 * For adults the ticket cost is 20
 * For senior citizens (attaining age 60) the ticket cost is 15
 * The function returns the computed ticket cost
 */
int ticketCost(int a)
{

/* Write code to compute and return ticket Cost based on age variable a */
int cost;
if(a<12)
 {cost=10;}
else if(a>=60) {cost=15;}
else cost=20;
return cost;


}
