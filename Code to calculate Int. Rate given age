Fixed deposit interest rate for a senior citizen (attaining age 60) is 0.5% more than others.
The fixed deposit interest rate for others is 8.25% per annum.
Write code which computes the interest rate in variable rate when variable a contains age.
int a;  /* Age of depositor for whom interest is to be computed */
float rate;  /* Variable where computed interest rate is to be stored */

rate=8.25;
if(a>=60) {rate+=0.5;}
