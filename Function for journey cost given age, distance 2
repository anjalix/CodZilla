Cost of a rail ticket for child less than 12 years is 50% of adult ticket.
For senior citizens (attaining age 60) the rail ticket cost is 80% of adult ticket.
For adults the tickets cost is based on distance tarvelled.
For every 50 kilometers or part thereof, the ticket cost is Rs. 20
Write a function ticketCost which computes and returns the ticket cost when age and distance are passed as parameters.
/*
 * The function ticketCost accepts an integer a (age of a person) and a distance d (in km)
 * It computes and returns the cost of a rail ticket based on the age and the distance
 * Cost of a rail ticket for child less than 12 years is 50% of adult ticket
 * For senior citizens (attaining age 60) the rail ticket cost is 80% of adult ticket
 * For adults the tickets cost is based on distance tarvelled
 * For every 50 kilometers or part thereof, the ticket cost is Rs. 20
 */
int ticketCost(int a, int d)
{

/* Write code to compute and return tickect Cost based on age variable a  and distance variable d */

int cost=0;
while(d>0)
{
cost+=20;
d=d-50;
}
if(a<12)
 {cost=cost/2;}
else if(a>=60) {cost=cost*0.8;}
return cost;

}
