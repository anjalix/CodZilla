Complete the reverseCharacter function to reverse 8 bits of the character operand and return the character with reversed bits.
The function should accept a 8 bit character parameter c.
The function should return a character with reversed bits.
Character with bit sequence 1001110 will become 0111001
/*
 * The reverseCharacter function returns a 8 bit character with reversed bits
 * The function accepts a 8 bit character parameter c
 * Character with bit sequence 1001110 will become 0111001
 */
char reverseCharacter(char c)
{

/* Write Code to return the reversed bits of the parameter c */
int count=8;
char a;
char last;

while(count--)
{
last=c&1;
c=c>>1;
a=a<<1;
a=a|last;
}
return a;


}


 
 Wow! Your solution is 100% correct!
