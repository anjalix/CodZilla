One can classify people on their height from the following table (different for men and women).
               Code  Men    Women
    Very Tall  "VT"  183     175
    Tall        "T"  175     168
    Medium      "M"  168     160
    Short       "S"  152     145
    Very Short "VS" <152    <145
Write a function which accepts gender (1 if male, 0 if female) and h (height in cms)
    height (in cms) is in variable h
    and determines the height code and returns it
/*
 * The function getHeight accepts two integers male (gender : 1 if male, 0 if female) and h (height in cms)
 * It should compute and return the height code based on gender and height
 */
char *getHeight(int male, int h)
{

/* Write code (including new variables) to store grade based on on number of subjects and the total marks */
if(male==1)
{
if(h>=183) {return "VT"; }
else if(h>=175) {return "T"; }
else if(h>=168) {return "M"; }
else if(h>=152) {return "S"; }
else  {return "VS"; }
}
else
{

if(h>=175) {return "VT"; }
else if(h>=168) {return "T"; }
else if(h>=160) {return "M"; }
else if(h>=145) {return "S"; }
else  {return "VS"; }



}
