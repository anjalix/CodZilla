//



Write code to compute the sum of squares of all the digits of a given number.
The number is supplied in the variable num.
The computed sum of squares should be stored in variable sum.
If the number is -ve, the -ve sign is to be ignored.
int num;
int sum;

/* Write your code (including variables) to calculate sum of suares of each digit */
sum=0;
if(num<0) {num*=-1;}
while(num>0)
{
sum=sum+(num%10)*(num%10);
num=num/10;
