Write code to calculate square of velocity by the formula (square of u +  2 times a times s).
The code should accept values of initial velocity, acceleration, and distance in variables u,a,s respectively.
The code should store the value of calculated square of final velocity in variable sqV.
float u;  /* Has value of initial velocity */
float a;  /* Has value of acceleration */
float s;  /* Has value of distace */
float sqV;  /* Stores value of calculated square of final velocity */
/* Write code to compute and store  value of square of final velocity in variable sqV here */

sqV= u*u +2*a*s;

Wow! Your solution is 100% correct!
