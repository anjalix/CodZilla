Code function calculateMedian to find and return Median of all elements of a sorted array.
The function should accept the number of elements and an array of integers as parameters.
median is the value of the element residing in the middle when the elements are sorted.
In case the array has even elements the median is the average of the two center elements.
It should return the Median of all the elements of the given sorted array.
  
/*      
 * The calculateMedian Function accepts the number of elements (e) and a sorted array of integers (a) as parameters
 * It finds and returns the Median of all the elements of the given sorted array
 */ 
float calculateMedian(int e, int *a)
{

/* Write code to calculate and return the median value here */
int mid=e/2;
float median;
if(e%2==0) {  median= *(a+mid) + *(a+mid-1); median=median/2; }
else {median=*(a+mid);}

return median;




}
 
 Wow! Your solution is 100% correct!
