Write Code to find minimum element of an array.
int  e;  /* Number of elements in array */
int *a;  /* Array of elements for which minimum has to be found */
int  min;  /* Variable to store minimum element found */

/* Write code to find and store minimum value in variable min here */
min=*a;
while(e--)
{
if(min>*a) {min=*a;}
a++;
}
